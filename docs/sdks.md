# SDKs

## Implemented

* [Python](./sdks-python.md)
* [Node.JS](./sdks-node.md)

## Writing your own

To write your own simulator, the main thing to take into account is compatiblity with [grpc.io](https://grpc.io). For example code, feel free to take a look at the [grpc tutorials](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/) to see on how you are able to utilize this for your own language.

Once you are able to get started with grpc.io, the next thing is to implement the API as defined earlier.
